\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusions}
In this work we determined whether PMOEAs could be used to solve the VNFPP more efficiently than sequential MOEAs without harming solution quality. We found that not only is this true, but that in certain instances PMOEAs produce better representations of the Pareto front than a comparable sequential algorithm. These results indicate that PMOEAs have potential to solve practical VNFPPs and are worthy of further research. Future work will explore alternative neighbor generation strategies to provide improved local search capabilities. Additional research could extend PMOEAs from single CPU, multithreaded systems to multi-cpu distributed systems in pursuit of larger speedups.
